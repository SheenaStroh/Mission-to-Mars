# Mission to Mars

## Overview
Built a web app by scraping various pieces of Mars information from other websites, compiling them into one. The site includes a news article, a recent picture from Mars, a table of facts, and high resolution images of the four hemispheres. The website also includes a scraping button to grab new information as it is available from the source websites.
